# AdventOfCode
 It's my advent of code repo, innit? :P

## Ok, but how are you supposed to run it?
I've been just copy/pasting the contents of each script file into the web inspector's console on the page that opens when I hit "get your puzzle input"

If you'd prefer, you could modify the inputData bits and get it from a text file and run it in node, but I'll leave fiddling with that up to you.

Or you can comment out the inputData line and uncomment the line that uses the example data as input and run that in probably(?) any JavaScript context, I hope? And, that's assuming I bothered to hardcode the example data in, which I might not have on each one...

## Why is your JS for AoC 2021 written like it's 2012?

Maybe I'm dyslexic? I know that doesn't make sense, but... shut up :P
I writes how I writes, ok? Maybe someday I'll get with the times... until then, stay off of my lawn!

### That's it?
Yep! gl, hf, mc, <3
